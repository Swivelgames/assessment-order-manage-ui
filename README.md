# Assessment: Order Management UI

I wrote this in about a day and a half for an assessment. There's certainly areas for improvement, and I may keep chipping at it for fun in the future. We'll see!

## Getting Started

This project was developed using Node `v12.16.1`.

### Install Project Dependencies

npm i
```

### Preview In Browser

To start the dev server to view it in the browser, run:

```shell

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/

```

And publish the files in the `dist/` directory.
